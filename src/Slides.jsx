                    The period of time after the Civil War was called the
                    Reconstruction Era. It lasted from 1865 to 1877 and was a
                    time of rebuilding the South and integrating freed slaves
                    into society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the Civil War, there were four million newly freed
                    slaves in the South, but they had no clear rights or
                    liberties to guide them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next decade, Congress would pass laws, form public
                    services, and enact new amendments that aimed to establish
                    civil rights for African Americans, but these laws were
                    often met with resistance and were not always enforced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What were some of these laws, and why may they have been
                    resisted by Southern states?

                    Almost immediately following the War, Southern states passed{" "}
                    <strong>Black Codes</strong>. These were laws designed
                    specifically to limit the rights of African Americans and
                    maintain white supremacy in the South.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, many Black Codes restricted the ability of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loitering</li>
                        <li>Property Ownership</li>
                        <li>Testifying in Court</li>
                        <li>Homelessness</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Southern states used these laws to continue to control
                    African Americans, pressure blacks into low paying labor
                    jobs and keeping blacks in submission, much like slavery
                    again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The North did not respond to this well, and released a
                    flurry of legislation aimed at protecting the rights of
                    African Americans and countering Black Codes.

                    Congress took a historical step, repassing a bill even after
                    being vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, making it one of
                    the first laws to pass despite presidential rejection. This
                    bill was the <strong>Civil Rights Act of 1866</strong>, a
                    direct response to the South's Black Codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This bill stated several important things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All persons born in the United States are citizens.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All citizens are entitled to the same rights and
                            protections under the law, regardless of race,
                            color, or ethnicity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Citizens have the right to make contracts, sue, give
                            evidence in court, and own property.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The act essentially nullified the Black Codes, but many
                    Southern states opposed to fully implement its mandates.
                    Congress would have to try even harder, with future
                    legislation and amendments.

                    Following the Civil War, three new amendments were added to
                    the Constitution, known as the{" "}
                    <strong>Reconstruction Amendments</strong>. These were the
                    13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. Their purpose: cover all
                    bases and ensure civil rights for those who needed it.
                </p>
                <h2>13th Amendment</h2>
                <p>
                    The 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865 and abolished
                    slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for
                    a crime. Slavery could no longer exist under the 10th
                    Amendment like it had before the Civil War, and this
                    amendment was a significant step towards ensuring equality
                    for all Americans.
                </p>
                <h2>14th Amendment</h2>
                <p>
                    The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 and granted
                    citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United
                    States, including former slaves. It guaranteed equal
                    protections under the law and due process to{" "}
                    <strong>all</strong> citizens, regardless of race, color, or
                    ethnicity. This required states to respect the civil
                    liberties of African Americans.
                </p>
                <h2>15th Amendment</h2>
                <p>
                    The 15th Amendment was ratified in 1870 and prohibited
                    rejecting the right to vote based on race, color, or
                    previous condition of servitude. This means formerly
                    enslaved persons were now allowed to vote, and it was a
                    major step towards political equality for African Americans.

                    While the Reconstruction Amendments were a significant step
                    towards ensuring civil rights for African Americans, other
                    violence began stirring in the South. A notorious group
                    known as the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) begun terrorizing blacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blacks who excercised their rights, like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Voting in elections</li>
                        <li>Running for public office</li>
                        <li>Serving on juries</li>
                    </ul>
                    were all at risk of being violently targeted by the KKK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The federal government responded to this violence with a
                    series of Enforcement Acts, aimed at outlawing any
                    interference with civil rights that were guaranteed in the
                    14th and 15th amendments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These acts lead to multiple KKK members being arrested, and
                    African Americans freely exercised their rights for a brief
                    period.
